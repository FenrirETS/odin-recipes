        <p>Chicken and dumplings recipe from my Hungarian father's side.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ¼ cups biscuit baking mix</li>
            <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
            <li>2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 (10 ounce) cans chunk chicken, drained</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together biscuit mix and milk in a medium bowl until dough comes together; set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour cans of chicken broth into a saucepan along with chicken; bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Take a handful of biscuit dough and flatten it in your hand. Tear off 1- to 2-inch pieces and drop them into boiling broth. Make sure they are fully immersed, at least for a moment. Repeat this step with remaining biscuit dough, then carefully stir soup, so dumplings are covered by broth.</li>
            <li>Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until dumplings are cooked through, about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
